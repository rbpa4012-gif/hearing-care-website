      "question": "How much do hearing aids cost in Caloundra, and what funding options are available?",
      "answer": "Hearing aid prices in Caloundra typically range from $1,500 to $6,000 per device, depending on the technology level and features you require. Australian Government funding through the Hearing Services Programme may fully or partially cover your hearing aids if you're a pensioner, veteran, or meet certain eligibility criteria.

      "question": "What's involved in the hearing aid fitting process at your Caloundra clinic?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive fitting process begins with a detailed hearing assessment and lifestyle discussion to determine the most suitable hearing aid style and technology for your needs. We use Real Ear Measurement (REM) technology, the gold standard in hearing aid fitting, which involves placing a tiny microphone in your ear canal to verify that your hearing aids are delivering the exact amplification prescribed for your unique hearing loss. The initial fitting appointment typically takes 60-90 minutes and includes programming your devices, teaching you how to insert and remove them, demonstrating maintenance procedures, and connecting any wireless accessories or smartphone apps. We schedule a follow-up appointment within two weeks to fine-tune settings based on your real-world experiences around Caloundra and the Sunshine Coast."

      "question": "Which hearing aid styles work best for the Sunshine Coast lifestyle?",
      "answer": "For active Sunshine Coast residents who enjoy our beaches, outdoor markets, and coastal walks, we often recommend Receiver-In-Canal (RIC) or Behind-The-Ear (BTE) models with high IP ratings for moisture and dust resistance. These styles typically offer the best battery life, are easier to handle for those with dexterity issues, and can accommodate more powerful technology for better performance in windy coastal conditions. For those prioritising discretion, Completely-In-Canal (CIC) and Invisible-In-Canal (IIC) options are virtually undetectable, though they may require more frequent battery changes and aren't suitable for all hearing loss levels. Many Caloundra clients choose rechargeable RIC models for the convenience of never buying batteries, especially important when travelling or enjoying extended days out on the Sunshine Coast."

      "question": "How do I maintain and care for my hearing aids in Caloundra's coastal environment?",
      "answer": "Caloundra's humid coastal climate requires extra attention to hearing aid maintenance to prevent moisture damage and ensure optimal performance. We recommend using a dehumidifier or drying kit nightly, especially during our humid summer months, and keeping spare wax filters to change weekly as beach activities and ocean air can increase wax production. Clean your devices daily with the provided tools and avoid using water or cleaning products not specifically designed for hearing aids. Our clinic provides complimentary cleaning and checks every three months, and we stock all necessary maintenance supplies including wax guards, domes, cleaning tools, and drying capsules specifically suited to Sunshine Coast conditions."

Oticon's BrainHearing technology focuses on supporting natural brain processing of sound and offers exceptional music quality, ideal for those attending concerts at The Events Centre Caloundra.

      "question": "Can I trial hearing aids before committing to purchase them?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer a comprehensive trial programme allowing you to test hearing aids in your daily Caloundra lifestyle for up to 30 days before making a final decision. During the trial period, you'll experience how the devices perform in your regular environments—whether that's at Caloundra RSL, shopping at Stockland Caloundra, or walking along Kings Beach. We can adjust settings throughout the trial to optimise performance, and you can even try different models or brands to find your perfect match. If you decide hearing aids aren't right for you, simply return them within the trial period for a full refund of any deposit paid, though most clients find the improvement in their quality of life makes them indispensable."

    {
      "question": "What ongoing support and warranty services do you provide for hearing aid users?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive aftercare programme includes unlimited fine-tuning appointments, quarterly professional cleaning and checks, and annual hearing reviews to ensure your devices continue meeting your needs as they may change over time. All hearing aids come with manufacturer warranties ranging from two to five years covering repairs and replacements, and we handle all warranty claims directly from our Caloundra clinic to minimise inconvenience. We offer same-day repairs for minor issues, loan devices if your hearing aids need to be sent away for service, and emergency appointments for urgent problems, ensuring you're never without hearing support on the Sunshine Coast. Additionally, our team provides ongoing education about new features, accessories, and technologies that could enhance your hearing experience, keeping you connected with the latest advancements."
