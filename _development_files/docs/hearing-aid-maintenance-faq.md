# Frequently Asked Questions - Hearing Aid Maintenance and Repair Services

## How often should I have my hearing aids professionally serviced?

We recommend professional maintenance every 4-6 months for optimal performance. These appointments include deep cleaning using specialised tools, electroacoustic testing to verify proper function, replacement of worn components like wax guards and domes, and hearing reassessment if needed. Regular professional maintenance prevents many common problems, extends device lifespan, and proves more economical than reactive repairs. Between professional services, daily home cleaning and proper storage are essential for maintaining your hearing aids.

## What does professional hearing aid maintenance include at your Caloundra clinic?

Our comprehensive professional maintenance includes deep cleaning of all accessible components, electroacoustic analysis to verify gain and frequency response, replacement of wax guards and worn parts, connectivity and feature testing, and quick hearing checks with programming updates when needed. For RIC devices, we perform deep receiver cleaning and wire connection checks. For custom devices, we clean sound bores and replace internal wax filters. This thorough service prevents future issues and ensures your devices continue performing optimally.

## How long do hearing aid repairs typically take?

Simple repairs like component replacement or deep cleaning are often completed same-day during your appointment. More complex issues requiring manufacturer repair typically take 1-3 weeks, depending on the problem and parts availability. We manage the entire repair process including manufacturer authorisation, shipping, progress tracking, and notification when your devices return. Loaner hearing aids are available when possible during extended repairs to ensure you maintain hearing support throughout the repair period.

## Do you service hearing aids purchased from other providers?

Yes, we provide hearing aid maintenance and repair services for most brands and models, regardless of where devices were originally purchased. Whether you need routine professional cleaning, troubleshooting performance issues, replacing worn components, or arranging manufacturer repairs, we offer complete support. This ensures Sunshine Coast residents have access to local professional service even if they purchased devices elsewhere or relocated to the Caloundra area after their original fitting.

## What should I do if my hearing aid stops working?

First, try replacing batteries or fully recharging the device, then clean wax guards, receivers, and sound bores thoroughly. Confirm the hearing aid is turned on and set to the correct program. If these steps don't resolve the issue, the problem likely requires professional service. Bring your devices to our Caloundra clinic where we can diagnose the issue using specialised equipment and either repair on-site or arrange manufacturer service if needed.

## Are hearing aid repairs covered under warranty?

Most hearing aids include 2-3 year manufacturer warranties covering defects and component failures under normal use. We verify your warranty status and process claims on your behalf. However, damage from misuse, water exposure, or physical trauma is typically excluded from warranty coverage. For out-of-warranty repairs, we provide quotes before proceeding so you can make informed decisions about repair versus replacement options.

## How can I extend the lifespan of my hearing aids?

Hearing aids typically last 5-7 years with proper care. Extend lifespan through daily cleaning each evening, overnight storage in protective cases or dehumidifiers, regular battery management, and professional maintenance every 4-6 months. Avoid exposure to water, extreme heat, hairspray, and cosmetics. Keep devices away from pets as chewing damage is extremely common. Even with excellent care, humidity, sweat, dust, and long daily use increase wear, so planning ahead for eventual replacement ensures continuity of hearing support.

## What causes hearing aid feedback whistling and how do I fix it?

Feedback whistling typically occurs when sound leaks back into the microphone. First, try reinserting devices ensuring a proper seal in your ear canal. Professional earwax removal often resolves whistling as wax causes sound reflection. Replace damaged domes or wax guards that may have deteriorated. If whistling persists after these steps, programming adjustments or physical modifications to the hearing aid or earmould may be needed—bring your devices to our clinic for assessment and resolution.
